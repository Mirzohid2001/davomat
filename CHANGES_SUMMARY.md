# Salary and Bonus Calculation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Salary Not Saving for Next Month
**Problem**: When assigning salary to workers, it was not being saved for the next month. Each new month required manual salary entry.

**Root Cause**: In `blog/services.py`, the `calculate_monthly_stats` function was using a hardcoded salary of 1000 when no previous record existed, instead of carrying over the previous month's salary.

**Solution**: Modified the function to:
- Check for the previous month's salary record
- If found, use that salary as the default for the new month
- Only use the hardcoded 1000 value for employees who have no previous records

### 2. Currency Not Saving for Next Month
**Problem**: When changing currency for workers, it was not being saved for the next month. Each new month defaulted back to UZS.

**Root Cause**: In `blog/services.py`, the currency was not being carried over from the previous month's record.

**Solution**: Modified the function to:
- Check for the previous month's currency record
- If found, use that currency as the default for the new month
- Only use the default 'UZS' value for employees who have no previous records

### 3. Bonus Being Deducted Based on Attendance
**Problem**: The bonus system was dividing the bonus by working days and deducting it when workers missed days. The system should give full bonus regardless of attendance and only deduct from salary based on worked days.

**Root Cause**: In `blog/services.py`, the bonus was being calculated proportionally with salary based on worked days:
```python
accrued = (salary + bonus - penalty) * proportion
```

**Solution**: Modified the calculation logic to:
- Calculate salary proportionally based on worked days
- Give full bonus regardless of attendance
- Only apply penalties to the final amount

## Changes Made

### 1. `blog/services.py`
- **Lines 35-45**: Added logic to carry over previous month's salary and currency
- **Lines 68-112**: Modified all employee type calculations to separate salary and bonus calculations
  - Salary is calculated proportionally based on worked days
  - Bonus is given in full regardless of attendance
  - Final accrued amount = proportional_salary + full_bonus - penalty
- **Lines 130-140**: Added currency field to both create and update operations

### 2. `blog/views.py`
- **Lines 1102-1104**: Added recalculation of accrued amount when salary/bonus is edited
- This ensures that when users edit salary or bonus values, the accrued amount is recalculated using the new logic

## Employee Type-Specific Changes

### Office Employees (`office`)
- **Before**: Full salary + bonus regardless of attendance
- **After**: Same behavior (no change needed)

### Full-time Employees (`full`)
- **Before**: (Salary + bonus) × (worked_days / working_days)
- **After**: (Salary × worked_days / working_days) + full_bonus

### 15-day Workers (`half`)
- **Before**: (Salary + bonus) × (worked_days / 15)
- **After**: (Salary × worked_days / 15) + full_bonus

### Weekly Workers (`weekly`)
- **Before**: (Salary + bonus) × (worked_days / 4)
- **After**: (Salary × worked_days / 4) + full_bonus

### Guards (`guard`)
- **Before**: (Salary + bonus) × (worked_days / 10)
- **After**: (Salary × worked_days / 10) + full_bonus

## Testing

The changes have been tested with:
- `python manage.py check` - No errors
- `python manage.py makemigrations` - No new migrations needed

## Impact

1. **Salary Persistence**: Salaries will now automatically carry over to the next month
2. **Currency Persistence**: Currency will now automatically carry over to the next month
3. **Bonus Protection**: Bonuses will be given in full regardless of attendance
4. **Fair Salary Calculation**: Only the base salary will be prorated based on worked days
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing data and functionality remain unchanged
